# The usage of "project_analyze.sh"
If only type in "project_analyze", it will list the function you can use and the introduction.

Function6 can **find and delete all UNTRACKED (and untracked only) ﬁles ending in the extension .tmp**

Function8 can **change binary system, octal number system, hexadecimal, thirty-two base and sixty-four base to decimalism** by enter 
system you need to transfor and the number you want to change.
